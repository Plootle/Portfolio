### ðŸš€ Projects

### Event Vesta
Implemented an automated email service API to facilitate communication between event hosts and attendees. This helps simplify event sharing for hosts and provides an all-in-one location for people to find local events. 
For event hosts, also developed a template builder using Ruby on Rails to efficiently share events on multiple websites. The step by step template builder allows users to create a great template that is compatible with all the local event listings.


### <a href="https://github.com/Plootle/BeeGame">Bee Managment </a>
This project is a resource management game themed around Bees. The obejective of the game is help the  bee colony grow and survive from a set amount of days by increasing production of resources, maintaining enough bees in the colony to operate, and having troops to protect the hive from enemies. Based all in Java, this project was made in order to apply a lot of the principles I learned about Object Oriented Programming.

### ðŸ’¡ Interest

Since I was a kid I have always loved cars and trucks. The amount of work and passion that people put into their cars is always inspiring me to pursue my own project car. Right now I am researching and looking into getting a kei truck, specifically a Suzuki Carry! These Japanese work trucks have a unique design that stands out here in America as they are very rare here. Looking into the kei truck community, even the simplest modification can add a lot of personality to the truck! The plan is to have one by end of Fall 2023 and start with a simple lift kit and bigger tires for off-roading!

In order to get out of the house and be able to enjoy nature I dearly enjoy the outdoors that Colorado provides. Since my move to this state I have done many activities with my family. All the way from mountain biking, hiking, swimming, camping, fishing, and boat rowing.

As I became more interested in technology I couldnâ€™t let go of playing video games. Along the way to picking my career I became more interested in computers and have found it interesting and fun to build my own rigs. I have built two pcâ€™s so far, one that was a budget build and another one that I saved up my money for in order to get better performance than what I was using before.

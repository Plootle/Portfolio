### ðŸš€ Projects

### Event Vesta
Implemented an automated email service API to facilitate communication between event hosts and attendees. This helps simplify event sharing for hosts and provides an all-in-one location for people to find local events. 
For event hosts, also developed a template builder using Ruby on Rails to efficiently share events on multiple websites. The step by step template builder allows users to create a great template that is compatible with all the local event listings.


### <a href="https://github.com/Plootle/BeeGame">Bee Managment </a>
This project is a resource management game themed around Bees. The obejective of the game is help the  bee colony grow and survive from a set amount of days by increasing production of resources, maintaining enough bees in the colony to operate, and having troops to protect the hive from enemies. Based all in Java, this project was made in order to apply a lot of the principles I learned about Object Oriented Programming.

### ðŸ’¡ Interest

Since I was a kid I have always loved cars and trucks. The amount of work and passion that people put into their cars is always inspiring me to pursue my own project car. Right now I am researching and looking into getting a kei truck, specifically a Suzuki Carry! These Japanese work trucks have a unique design that stands out here in America as they are very rare here. Looking into the kei truck community, even the simplest modification can add a lot of personality to the truck! The plan is to have one by end of Fall 2023 and start with a simple lift kit and bigger tires for off-roading!

As I have continued to pursue my professional and academic interests, I have managed to keep my interests in video games. I have always gravitated towards games that require you to continue improving in order to continue stay competitive or challenge you in ways that most would become discouraged. My top two games currently are Valorant and Elden Ring. Valorant is my favorite multiplayer games as it requires precise aiming, understanding of agent abilities, and compability of team in order to gain a competitive edge againts the opposing team. I have also been personally invested into the games professional competitive scene and have enjoyed staying up to date with the teams (GO Sentinels!). Elden Ring on the other hand requires you to adapt and learn every enemies moves, as getting hit is often instant death or a severe punishment.

<p>Another personal interest is animals. As a kid I spent a lot of time around chickens, cows, and horses so I have always had a love for them. While I currently dont have any animals anymore, I plan on one day raising chickens in my backyard.</p>

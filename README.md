### 🚀 Projects

### Event Vesta
Implemented an automated email service API to facilitate communication between event hosts and attendees. This helps simplify event sharing for hosts and provides an all-in-one location for people to find local events. 
For event hosts, also developed a template builder using Ruby on Rails to efficiently share events on multiple websites. The step by step template builder allows users to create a great template that is compatible with all the local event listings.


### SARA Project 


### <a href="https://github.com/KevinFLoaiza/ChutesAndLadders">Snake and Ladders </a>
I made a snakes and ladders game that was made in intelliJ where we used Java. The purpose of the game is to reach tile 100 in a 10x10 grid where there are various obstacles that could increase the number of tiles you go up, which are stairs or go back if you land on the head of a snake to the tail. Each players takes turn rolling a die until they reach the final tile. 

### <a href="https://github.com/CSCI-3308-CU-Boulder/3308SP21_section013_5">Book Review </a>
This is an application that has a library of books that you can look up and it gives the user information on the book like the summary, the author, and the genre. Users can then upload a review if they have read the book and give it a rating that will be seen by other users. Tools that we used are docker, CSS, javascript, and HTML

### 💡 Interest

I used to volunteer a lot at my middle school and elementary school. I was a teacher's assistant and I found it pleasant teaching others. I mainly worked with students who were in the process of learning English and would grade their work or help translate writings. I still keep in contact with some of the teachers and it has been fulfilling even going back and seeing familiar faces.

In order to get out of the house and be able to enjoy nature I dearly enjoy the outdoors that Colorado provides. Since my move to this state I have done many activities with my family. All the way from mountain biking, hiking, swimming, camping, fishing, and boat rowing.

As I became more interested in technology I couldn’t let go of playing video games. Along the way to picking my career I became more interested in computers and have found it interesting and fun to build my own rigs. I have built two pc’s so far, one that was a budget build and another one that I saved up my money for in order to get better performance than what I was using before.
